 * SINGLETON
 *
 *
 * singleton is a creationla pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance,
 * while providing a global access point to this instance.
 *
 * Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this
 * is to control access to some shared resourceâ€”for example, a database or a file.
 *
 * All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:
 *
 * 1) Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with
 *    the Singleton class.
 *
 * 2) Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls
 *    the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.
 *

class Singleton {
  private static instance: Singleton;
  private constructor() {}

  public static getInstance(): Singleton {
    if (!this.instance) {
      this.instance = new Singleton();
    }
    return this.instance;
  }
}

// usage :
const singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
